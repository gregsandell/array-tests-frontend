# Greg Sandell's array-credit-lock solution

Video presentation:  [https://youtu.be/uWUadD9SWas](https://youtu.be/uWUadD9SWas)

## Instructions
To run:  right click on `completedAssignment.html` and select `Open with Live Server`

# The challenge
The original code and files are in the `assignment` folder.

## Issues encountered in challenge instructions
It was unclear to me what the goal of the SVG elements were, because they were inactive/invisible when previwing
`assignment/test_page.html`.  An email query to Zachary First was unable to
provide clarity.  So I have left the SVGs out of the solution.

Zachary First instructed me to mark an item `Unlocked` if its `type` field is *cancellation*, and `Locked` when *enrollment*.

# My Comments
This my first experience working with both [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components), and GitLab/GitPod
so I may not be familiar with Best Practices and the most efficient way of writing the code.
